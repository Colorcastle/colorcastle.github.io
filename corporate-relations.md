IEEE@IIT is a premier organization focused on serving the students and faculty of the ECE department. As the largest organization within ECE, IEEE has the ability to directly reach a substantial number of ECE students in order to involve them in IEEEâ€™s activities, which include:

*   Technical Workshops
*   Student Projects
*   Corporate Events

The goal of IEEE Corporate is to bridge the communication gap between the companies and the students. Through our events, students learn more about the new products and technologies that companies have to offer, while being exposed to a larger pool of job opportunities. In turn, the companies are able to reach the best ECE students in the department and target a larger number of students for presentations.

### IEEE Corporate Events include:

*   **Info Sessions/Technical Presentations**

    IEEE hosts company presentations at least every two weeks, and the student turnout ranges from 30 to as many as 150 students. Past companies that have presented include Motorola, Intel, Boeing, Micron, and AMD. By spacing the corporate events out, we are able to actively publicize the event to IEEE members, and students from other organizations/departments at least a week in advance. The presentation is followed by company-sponsored pizza and refreshments.

*   **Luncheons**

    Luncheons are an excellent way to meet the dynamic and successful IEEE Exec board and General Members. We select a group of students to attend the luncheon with company representatives, hosted at the Priztker Club.

    Companies usually prefer to hold luncheons and info sessions on the same day; having the luncheon at noon and the info session at 5pm in a lecture hall.

*   **Resume Book**

    The students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) here at the Illinois Institute of Technology are some of the most motivated and talented individuals in the College of Engineering. We here at IEEE allow all our student members in the ECE Department and in other departments of the Armour College of Engineering to upload their resumes to our database. *Only* Corporate Sponsors of IEEE are given access to this database.

    If you are a student and would like to upload your resume to our database, please visit our [submission form.]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume/)

*   **Sponsorship**

    IEEE is currently looking for companies to sponsor an upgrade of the IEEE Student Lab, as well as sponsor technical workshops or projects. Such sponsorships will certainly add to the visibility of the company among IEEE members.

We are also open to organizing other events such as company visits or on-campus interviews. Your support for a Corporate Event will reap benefits far beyond expected to both IEEE and your corporation.

_We look forward to discussing your company's involvement with IEEE Corporate at your earliest convenience._
