Ardupilot is an open source unmanned aerial vehicle platform, able to control autonomous multicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, traditional helicopters and ground rovers. This group has achieved the Ardupilot simulation by designed 10 small projects. They are currently building sailplane, and plan to achieve Ardupilot UAV in May 2014.

## Guitar Amplifier
### Creating a guitar amplifier.

**Meeting time: Every Thursday from 8:00pm-9:30pm and every Saturday from 6:30pm-8:00pm.**

A guitar amplifier is an electronic amplifier designed to amplify the electrical signal of an electric or acoustic guitar so that it will produce sound through a loudspeaker. This group has researched on the necessary parts. They are finishing circuit and mounting them together. In this semester, they plan to successfully test the completed amplifier and construct a case for the entire amplifier.

Kinect is a line of motion sensing input devices by Microsoft for Xbox 360. It enables users to control and interact with computer by gestures and spoken commands. How to make this project interesting is still under consideration. A possible way is to write Kinecting apps to help the children to study languages or courses. This project is expected to organize the project group in this semester and officially start to work in next semester.

## Multi-touch Surface
### We are making a multi-touch surface.

**Meeting time: Every Wednesday from 12:50pm to 1:50pm.**

Multi-touch is a technique which allows more than one users to interact with computer by multiple fingers. The examples of the application of the multi-touch technique in industry include the Apple Iphone, Mircosoft Surface and SamSung Galaxy. In this project, the Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR) was applied to build a multi-touch surface because of its low cost. This project includes both the hardware and the software. The hardware group aims to build a flexible and reliable multi-touch table which can be safely operated in a long time and is easy to be moved from one place to another, and the software group is to develop a multi-touch library which includes the interaction between the human and the computer and some interesting applications. We also seek to the possible cooperation of the multi-touch surfaces and the Kinect.

## Quadcopter
### We will be building a quadcopter and flying it.

**Meeting time: Every Friday from 12:50pm-1:50pm.**

**Meeting location: SH013 (IEEE room)**

A quadcopter is a multicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. The goal of our project is to successfully build a user-programmable quad-copter from scratch, and have it flying and working by the Spring of 2014. The group is divided into different subgroups according to the parts they are researched, and Professor John Kallend is the supervisor.

Current project ideas to be done in collaboration with Dennis Roberson ([company website](http://robersonandassociates.com/)):

1.  Data analysis of wireless measurement data to model it and create wireless traffic generator from the model.
2.  Compare the measured data with human activity like weather, ball games, etc.
3.  Parabolic Dish antenna setup to track the satellite for 1675-1710 MHz.
4.  Use [satview.org](http://satview.org/) and download the text data to create a simulation map of the earth that has color values representing the average power levels experienced in the 1675-1710 MHz band over 24 hours.
